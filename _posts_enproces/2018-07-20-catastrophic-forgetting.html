This post (my first post!) is about the work I did during my internship in Telef√≥nica Research 
(<a href="https://twitter.com/tefresearch">@TEFresearch</a>) Recently my advisor <a href="http://joanserra.weebly.com/">
  Joan</a> presented the work in the ICML conference, in Stockholm (you will find the video of his talk is at the end of
  the blog), so I thought it was a good excuse to start writing something in my blog. A previous blog by my colleague 
  Marius also inspired me to write something on the topic.

This is an introduction to the topic and a brief overview of our paper (link paper)
