## Catastrophic forgetting

This post (my first post!) is about the work I did during my internship in Telef√≥nica Research 
([@TEFresearch](https://twitter.com/tefresearch)). Recently my advisor [Joan](http://joanserra.weebly.com/) presented
the work in the ICML conference, in Stockholm (you will find the video of his talk is at the end of the blog)

A previous blog by my collegue Marius inspired me to write something on the topic

This is an introduction to the topic and a brief overview of our paper (link paper)
