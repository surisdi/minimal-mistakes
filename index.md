<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am a computer vision researcher at <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a>, working in 
Professor Sanja Fidler's lab. I am interested in multimodal machine learning, or how to use different sources
of information to formulate and solve computer vision and artificial intelligence problems.
</p>
<p>
  This website is a very young personal project, in which I will try to explain how I see the computer vision
  world, and I will progressively fill with information about me, my projects and my interests.

  It may or may not be up to date, but you can always contact me.
