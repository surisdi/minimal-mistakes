<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am a computer vision PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>, under the 
  supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/">Professor Carl Vondrick</a>, in New York 
  (or if you prefer, <i>The city that never sleeps</i>,
  <i>Gotham</i>, <i>The big apple</i>, and a large assortment of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicknames_of_New_York_City">other names</a>).
</p>

<p>
I am interested in multimodal 
machine learning, or how to use different sources of information &mdash;like vision, audio and text&mdash; to formulate and solve computer vision and 
artificial intelligence problems. My interests also include self-supervised and active learning, and in general all
the areas of artificial intelligence that involve using all the available information in an intelligent way.
</p>
  <p>
  Before moving to New York, I was a researcher at the 
  <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a>, working in 
<a href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/">Professor Sanja Fidler's lab</a>. I was previously a visiting student at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">CSAIL-MIT</a>, working in 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/">Professor Antonio Torralba's lab</a>, and I studied both the 
undergrad and a Master's in telecommunications in the <a href="https://etsetb.upc.edu">ETSETB-UPC</a>, in Barcelona.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I like to play the classical guitar. Maybe (probably not) some day I'll upload some recording of me playing.
</p>

<p>
  This website is a very young personal project, in which I will try to explain how I see the computer vision
  world, and that I will progressively fill with information about me, my projects and my interests.

  It may or may not be up to date, but you can always contact me.
