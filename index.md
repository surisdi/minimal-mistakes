<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  I am a computer vision researcher at <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a>, working in 
<a href="https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/">Professor Sanja Fidler's lab</a>. I am interested in multimodal 
machine learning, or how to use different sources of information to formulate and solve computer vision and 
artificial intelligence problems. My interests also include unsupervised and active learning, and in general all
the areas of artificial intelligence that involve using all the available information in an intelligent way.
</p>
<p>
I was previously a visiting student at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">CSAIL-MIT</a>, working in 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/">Professor Antonio Torralba's lab</a>, and I studied both the 
undergrad and a Master's in telecommunications in the <a href="https://etsetb.upc.edu">ETSETB-UPC</a>, in Barcelona.
</p>

<p>
  On September I will start a PhD at Columbia University in New York (or if you prefer, <i>the city that never sleeps</i>,
  <i>Gotham</i>, <i>the big apple</i>, and a large assortment of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicknames_of_New_York_City">other names</a>), under the
  supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vondrick/">Professor Carl Vondrick</a>.
</p>

<p>
  This website is a very young personal project, in which I will try to explain how I see the computer vision
  world, and that I will progressively fill with information about me, my projects and my interests.

  It may or may not be up to date, but you can always contact me.
